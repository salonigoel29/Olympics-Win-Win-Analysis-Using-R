### 1. Introduction

<font size="3">**It takes a lot of money to prepare and send athletes to the Olympics.**  Consider: their training, coaching, and access to facilities. Who bears this financial burden?  It varies; some countries pay for everything, but in other countries a significant portion is paid by the athlete and their family.  \

Thus, the International Olympic Committee has a [scholarship program](https://stillmed.olympics.com/media/Document%20Library/OlympicOrg/IOC/Who-We-Are/Commissions/Olympic-Solidarity/Olympic-Scholarships-for-Athletes-Results-Rio-2016.pdf?_ga=2.214502034.464514119.1638446536-1164305563.1635902413), whose objective is to provide financial assistance to athletes from less privileged countries the chance to prepare for and qualify for the Olympic Games.  \

**How are these athletes chosen?**    Currently, the athlete's home country identifies candidates and the athletes apply for the scholarship.  The final decision lies with the "Olympic Solidarity"  committee. 

**Proposal: **  The IOC could play a more proactive part, *seeking* athletes that fill a particular need or goal, for a "win-win".   These strategic goals could target specific sports or countries where the IOC wants to put emphasis.  \

For example: (1)  Increase participation in certain "niche" sports that currently have comparatively less participation.  (2) Equalize male & female participation in certain sports. (3) Provide more scholarships to emerging countries that show promise to earn more medals. \


**Why?**  Taking a more active role builds on the philanthropy of the IOC, and, allows the IOC to achieve multiple objectives at the same time.  

**Approach** We'll use statistical, visual analysis, and data science techniques to bring this data to life.  We will connect data about athletes with information about their home country and employ the muscle of R to find meaningful correlations and insights. </font>\

### 3. Data Preparation

<font size="3">**3.1 Source of data**</font>\
<font size="3"> This dataset comes from [Kaggle - Rio Olympics](https://www.kaggle.com/rio2016/olympic-games), (note, link may not open using Windows Explorer), which also cites the [ Official Olympics Website](https://olympics.com/en/athletes/) as the original source. The dataset was created in Dec 2016 and consists of the official statistics for all of the athletes and events at the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.</font> \
<font size="3"> 3 csv files were available, but we only used two of them.  Please see explanation under "Peculiarities".</font>\
<font size="3">Files:</font>\
<font size="3">-Athletes.csv</font>\
<font size="3">-Countries.csv</font>\
<font size="3">-Events. csv</font>\


<font size="3"> **3.2 Variables,  Missing Values, Peculiarities **</font>\
<font size="3"> **3.2.1 Import Files & Review Variables**</font>\
<font size="3"> In this step we import files for athletes and countries and merge together on the nationality & country code.  We specified a left join from our athlete file, which will allow us to see how many participants did not get associated with a country.  We have general athlete information like name, birthdate, height, weight and from the country file we get the country name, population, and GDP. </font>\

```{r  , echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE , message = FALSE  }


athletes <- read.csv("athletes.csv" , stringsAsFactors=FALSE)


countries <- read.csv("countries.csv" , stringsAsFactors=FALSE)


rio_orig <- merge(x=athletes, y=countries, by.x="nationality", by.y="code" , all.x = TRUE)



```



<font size="3"> **3.2.2  Missing Values and Imputation**  <font size="3">\
<font size="3"> First, let's look at the number of complete observations.</font>\
<font size="3"> We have 10,109 complete records out of 11,538 = 87% complete </font>\
```{r , echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}

num_complete <- sum(complete.cases(rio_orig)  ) 

```
 <font size="3"> **We have 5 columns with missing values** </font>\
 <font size="3"> **Percent Missing by Column** </font>\
```{r , echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE , message = FALSE}

percent_missing <- as.data.frame(colSums(is.na(rio_orig))/nrow(rio_orig)*100)

percent_missing  %>% 
       filter(percent_missing  > 0 ) %>%

       kbl(caption = "Percent Missing") %>%
       kable_classic(full_width = F, html_font = "Cambria")



```

 <font size="3">**What should we do about missing values?**</font>\
<font size="3"> - **Height and Weight** We will impute the missing values. \
<font size="3">- **Population and GDP** - this is very specific information about a country so it doesn't make sense to impute.  We will leave as NULL.</font>\
<font size="3"> - **Country**  Our country csv file lacked many countries needed to join to the athlete csv file.  Looking at the athlete's nationality codes, we can look up the country (on internet) and add it to the dataset.  For example, the country code "KOS" represents "Kosovo", so we will manually add that in so we will not have any missing values in this column.  </font>\

### 4. Analysis & Recommendations

<font size="3"> In 2016 for the Rio Olympics, a budget of USD 22,000,000 provided individual and personalized support to 1,557 athletes from 185 countries. Out of these 1557, 815 athletes qualified for the games, and 101 medals were won.  Below, we offer ideas for how this money could be allocated in the future. </font>  \



<font size="3"> **Recommendation #1:  Increase funding for athletes participating in a sport where there is currently low country participation**  </font>  \

<font size="3"> **Rationale:**   Certain sports like Track & Field have ~ 200 countries participating, while at the other end of the spectrum, rugby has less than 15.  This recommendation will put the spotlight on these niche sports.  Plus, athletes participating in these sports will have a higher chance of success, and, more participation will bring more visibility to the sports.

### 5. Summary

<font size="3">  **Using analytics, we have identified strategic areas where the IOC could award more scholarships to athletes for a win-win:**  </font>  \ 



```{r}



```
 <font size="3"> 
 a. Increase country participation in sports like handball, basketball, hockey and rugby where not many countries participate compared to other sports.\
 b. Reward countries with a low GDP that have already had athletes on the podium, to build on their momentum, like:  
      Burundi  | Ivory Coast | Ethiopia  | India | Kenya | Moldova | Niger  |  Tajikistan  \
 c. Reward productive countries with low GDP, that have a high number of medals per athlete,  like: \
     Jamaica | Azerbaijan | Fiji |  Nigeria |  Ethiopia \
 d. Seek out more men gymnasts, and more women to participate in Rowing, Judo, Shooting, Equestrian, Cycling, Canoe, Wrestling, Boxing so there is better balance in these sports by gender.  
 e. Continue to sponsor independent athletes and refugees -- these athletes inspire us and shows the spirit of the IOC to make a difference in the world. 

 </font>  





```{r}

```

<font size="3">   **Limitations**  (1) We used data to uncover opportunities for strategic focus; ideally, we'd work with the IOC to fine tune this.  (2) We were limited to GDP to assess country prosperity, but, we would be interested in other things that could help compare the *athletic* capability between countries, like, number of professional coaches and access to facilities.  (3) We limited our analysis to one Olympic game, Rio.  We could use Tokyo Olympic data to see if the same recommendations stay consistent over time.   </font>  \  

<font size="3">   **Conclusion**   This proof-of-concept shows how much can be done with data to provide rigor into how scholarships could be awarded to help achieve a win - win:   athletes get a chance to compete and strategic goals by the governing body are met.  This would allow the IOC to play a more active role in the recruitment of athletes, and increase their overall engagement in the process.  </font>
