It takes a lot of money to prepare and send athletes to the Olympics. Consider: their training, coaching, and access to facilities. 

Who bears this financial burden? It varies; some countries pay for everything, but in other countries a significant portion is paid by the athlete and their family.  Thus, the International Olympic Committee has a scholarship program, whose objective is to provide financial assistance to athletes from less privileged countries the chance to prepare for and qualify for the Olympic Games. 

How are these athletes chosen? 

Currently, the athlete’s home country identifies candidates and the athletes apply for the scholarship. The final decision lies with the “Olympic Solidarity” committee.  

Proposal: The IOC could play a more proactive part, seeking athletes that fill a particular need or goal, for a “win-win”. These strategic goals could target specific sports or countries where the IOC wants to put emphasis. For example: 
(1) Increase participation in certain “niche” sports that currently have comparatively less participation. 
(2) Equalize male &amp; female participation in certain sports. 
(3) Provide more scholarships to emerging countries that show promise to earn more medals.
